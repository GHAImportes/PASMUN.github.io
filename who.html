<center><h2>Topic: Substance Abuse and Distribution of Pharmaceuticals in Underdeveloped Countries.</h2></center>
<center><p> Nowadays, the use of several substances is very common for those who have a desire of changing their mood, staying awake more time, or even changing their behavior. Even though most people keep the use of substances such as caffeine, illicit drugs, and alcohol as a recreational hobby, there is a point in which the regular use of these substances starts interfering with the normal functioning of the body. After the bodyâ€™s behavior, conditions and psychological structure has been altered by the usage of harming substances, only rehabilitation or a psychiatrist can contribute to decrease the consequences of these actions. However, because of the unequal economic distribution in developing and underdeveloped countries, most people who consume do not have conditions of being cured. This no-way-back condition caused by substance abuse, the misuse of alcohol, excess of cigarettes, illegal and legal drugs and wrong consume of medications is the predominant cause of illness, disability and death.
