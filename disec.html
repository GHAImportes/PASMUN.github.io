<center><h2>Topic: South China Sea Sovereignty and Biodiversity Loss</h2></center>
<center><p>The dispute in the South China Sea is of a large importance to China, the US and its allies and to much of the rest of the world.The South China Sea stretches from Malacca Straits to the Strait of Taiwan. Due the sea’s strategic importance and economic value several countries have laid claims over parts of the sea, however many of these claims overlap with claim from other countries. To solidify its claim China has started to build structures on disputed parts of the sea, these structures could strengthen China’s grasp on the region. This move from China prompted the US to intervene, the US holds interest in maintaining freedom of navigation and securing sea lines of communication and it also holds a defense treaty with The Philippines which is  involved in the dispute. The construction of the Chinese structures on the disputed lands has affected the delicate ecosystem which has resulted in a decline of both fish and coral population. This dispute could lead to a potential war or energy race, it is up to you delegates to find a solution which could prevent a global catastrophe.
