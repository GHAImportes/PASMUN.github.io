<center><h2>Topic: Coalition Against the Napoleonic Conquest</h2></center>
<center><p>During the 18th century, European nations underwent a constant struggle for power in which wars broke out frequently to assert dominance over territories. Alliances formed and fell quickly as interests changed and land was lost or gained. During this time, the nations were ruled under monarchies which often spanned great empires, and democracy was still a foreign concept. Four main nations-- The Archduchy of Austria, the Kingdom of Prussia, Great Britain, and France-- held most of the power in Europe, and had control over certain colonies within and without the continent. However, things quickly changed with the rise of the French Republic and the Napoleonic conquest for power. The unrest in Europe broke out after the execution of King Louis XVI of France in the French Revolution. To stop revolutionary ideas from spreading, several nations such as Great Britain, the Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal, the Dutch Republic, Naples, and Sicily formed the First Coalition against France. However, they faced defeat during battle, and were defeated yet again after forming the Second Coalition. Now, it is the year 1803 and the Treaty of Amiens-- which had kept hostilities between France and Great Britain at bay-- has been broken. European Nations such as Great Britain, the Holy Roman Empire, the Russian Empire, Sweden, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily have gathered to form the Third Coalition to stop Napoleonâ€™s conquests. It is your duty as Heads of State of these nations to stop his advances while keeping your borders and sovereignty intact, and to achieve victory to defeat Napoleon in this battle once and for all.
