<center><h2>Topic: Combating Terrorism and Piracy in Somalia and Neighboring Countries</h2></center>
<center><p>  In this conference, you will debate about the terrorism and piracy that have taken place in not only Somalia but their neighboring countries. For the past eight years, global headlines have featured conflicts regarding piracy off Somaliaâ€™s coasts. As a united council, we shall extend our efforts to assure encountering an adequate solution to this issue that affects the lives of countless people every day. Many parts of the country are being controlled by terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab (militant group) in which the group has a relationship with Al Qaeda, yet so the recent terrorist group ISIS has been also occupying Somali territory. The group Al Shabaab has wanted to influence and force Somalia to be an official territory base.  Not only is Somalia dealing with terrorist groups but also with piracy. Somalia has a rich ocean full of a diversity of fishes that have a high cost. Most of the Somali piracy is based on the illegal fishing market now that travelers have forced many to use piracy as a living. In northern Somalia, government officials have been patrolling and securing the seas but the pirates are not going to surrender and quit to the piracy and have formed groups with weapons to fight against the officials.
