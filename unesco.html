<center><h2>Topic: Protection of Cultural Heritage in times of Crisis</h2></center>
<center><p>Everyday, all around the world, but in recent times mostly in Iraq and Syria, cultural heritage sites, artifacts, writings or ideas are destroyed or oppressed. This problem has become increasingly more serious with the creation and foothold that ISIS has managed to gain in Iraq and Syria. It has been destroying locations and artifacts like those in Palmyra, which was just recently retaken by the Iraqi government and handed over to the UNESCO for a damage assessment. ISIS is responsible for the destruction of hundreds of Mosques, Synagogues and churches in these areas, which were dated to even hundreds of years old. It has been cleansing the cultural landscape of the areas it holds in order to make their "caliphate" "pure". Daesh is the perfect example of the destruction that cultural heritage suffers. It is not the only example though, in Afghanistan similar things are being done by the Taliban, but war is not the only cause for this destruction. In many places, tourism is destroying cultural heritage sites, like in Venice, where cruise ships have damaged the canals and disrupt the way the city must function. Many ancient sites are also hurt by foot traffic when over tourism damages the structure of a site. During hard times or just a fail in security, many art pieces and artifacts have been known to be stolen, like the Nazis did during World War II, only now they are sold of and in many cases damaged due to mistreatment. During times of prosperity, most cultural heritage can be maintained, but during crisis and war, it deteriorates as seen with Daesh and the WWII example. As of now most danger to cultural heritage is due to civil wars and terrorist extremists, but the UN must be prepared to deal with the unavoidable situation of crisis endangering cultural heritage, since time and time again these take their toll on the world's culture and history. Also, although it is not the committee's main goal, there should be some talk and results discussing how to stop the destruction of cultural heritage during times of peace and prosperity, since it does happen and is easier and less costly to avoid.
